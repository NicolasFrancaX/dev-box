dotfiles
========

Keeping versioned dotfiles so that I can mantain consistent development environments. Also, I'm able to watch the evolution as they grow hairy and messy :P

It's tailored for Arch Linux. But should work with minor changes on other environments.

In theory you could run `install.sh` and have everything working, I heard one person has done it and succeeded. But I offer no guarantees :P
