dotfiles
========

Keeping versioned dotfiles so that I can maintain consistent development environments. Also, I'm able to watch the evolution as they grow hairy and messy :P

It's tailored for [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/). But should work with minor changes on other environments.

Install
-------

[Puppet](http://puppetlabs.com/) is used to provision my development machine.

```bash
# puppet apply install.pp
```
