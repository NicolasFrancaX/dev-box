dotfiles
========

Keeping versioned dotfiles so that I can maintain consistent development environments. Also, I'm able to watch the evolution as they grow hairy and messy :P

It's tailored for [Arch Linux][1] using [Xfce][2].

[Puppet][3] is used in the install.

Install
-------

```bash
$ curl http://dotfiles.leafac.com | /bin/sh
```
